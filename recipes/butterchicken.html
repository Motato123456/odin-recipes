    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a popular Indian dish that combines succulent pieces of chicken with a rich and creamy tomato-based sauce. Originating in Delhi, this dish was created in the 1950s by chefs at the Moti Mahal restaurant, who used leftover tandoori chicken and simmered it in a buttery, spiced tomato sauce. The chicken is first marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices, including garam masala, turmeric, and chili powder, before being cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven) or grilled. The cooked chicken is then simmered in a sauce made with tomatoes, butter, cream, and a blend of aromatic spices, resulting in a luscious and flavorful dish. Butter chicken is typically served with naan, a type of Indian bread, or steamed rice, making it a favorite comfort food for many around the world.

        <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, garam masala, ground cumin, chili powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and mix well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers (if grilling) or place them on a baking sheet lined with foil (if using the oven).</li>
        <li>Grill or broil the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side, until slightly charred and cooked through. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another 2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato puree, ground cumin, ground coriander, garam masala, and chili powder. Cook the mixture for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the oil begins to separate from the tomato mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken pieces to the sauce. Pour in the heavy cream and water, stirring to combine. Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken.</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste.</li>
