    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter is a beloved dairy product made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk, separating the butterfat from the buttermilk. Known for its rich and creamy texture, butter plays a crucial role in various culinary traditions around the world. It enhances the flavor and texture of baked goods, sauces, and spreads, adding a luxurious mouthfeel to dishes. In addition to its culinary uses, butter is also appreciated for its nutritional content, providing a source of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, and E. Whether used in cooking, baking, or as a simple spread on bread, butter remains a staple ingredient that brings depth and richness to countless recipes.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Strong arms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the heavy cream into the bowl of your electric mixer or food processor. Make sure not to fill the bowl more than halfway to allow space for the cream to expand as it whips.</li>
        <li>As you keep whipping, the cream will eventually break down, and you'll notice the butterfat separating from the liquid (buttermilk). This process takes about 5-10 minutes. The butter will clump together, and you'll have a cloudy liquid (buttermilk) in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to separate the butter from the buttermilk. Save the buttermilk for baking or cooking if you like.</li>
        <li>Place the butter into a bowl and pour cold water over it. Use a spatula or your hands to knead the butter under the water. This helps remove any remaining buttermilk, which can spoil the butter quickly. Repeat this process a few times until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Store in airtight container</li>
    </ol>
